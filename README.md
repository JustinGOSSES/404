# 404
404 page ideas:
- Abandons user on deserted industrial island and let them wander around in 3D using google street view.
  - Seen here: http://justingosses.com/resume/4wsfa
  - When a 404 incident occurs the 404.php script redirects the user to the 404.html page. This means the actual content doesn't have to be inside of a PHP script, which makes it easier to debug when google changes something about streetview.
